Hello there! 🙋‍♀️

Welcome to the Shipment Management Form! 🚚 This form helps you keep track of your shipments by storing all your shipment data in a database. 📦

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the form:

📝 Input Fields
At the top of the form, you'll see some boxes where you can enter your shipment information. The boxes are for:

🚀 Shipment No.
📄 Description
🏭 Source
🏬 Destination
🚢 Shipping-Date
📅 Expected-Delivery-Date
🔑 Primary Key
The most important box is the "Shipment No." box. This is like a special code for each shipment.


🛠 Usage
When you open the form, only the "Shipment No." box will be active. 👀
Type in your Shipment No.
If the number you type in doesn't exist in the database, the "Save" and "Reset" buttons will light up. 🌟

You can then fill in the rest of the boxes. Remember, don't leave any box empty! 🤔
Once you've filled in all the boxes, click on the "Save" button to save your data to the database. 💾
If the number you type in already exists in the database, the form will fill in with the info you previously entered. 🎉
You can then make changes to any of the other boxes if you need to. Again, don't forget to fill in every box! 🤗
Once you've made changes, click on the "Update" button to save the new info to the database. 💾
If you want to start over and erase everything, just click on the "Reset" button! 🔙
Thank you for using our Shipment Management Form! I hope that it helps you manage your shipments better. 🤞
